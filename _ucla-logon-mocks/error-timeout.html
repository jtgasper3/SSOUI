<div role="status" class="warning">
	
	<h1>Your login session ran out of time</h1>
	
	<p>You waited just a <em>little</em> too long to start logging in. I'm sure that was a great cup of coffee though.</p>
	
	<p>Hey, it's not a problem! Just <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ucla-logon-mocks/">go and login</a> a little faster this time.</p>
