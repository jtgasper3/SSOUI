title: Warning, Login Attempts Slowed
---

<div role="alert">

	<h1>Login Attempts Slowed Down</h1>

	<p>We've noticed that there have been more than a few login attempts on this account recently. In order to protect your identity from someone trying to force their way into your account we've added a wait between login attempts. Or maybe it's just been a while and you've forgotten your password - hey it happens to the best of us.</p>
	
	<p>The simplest thing to do is to <a href="#">go request a password reset</a>. Of course you can just wait a bit and keep on trying if you really want to!</p>
