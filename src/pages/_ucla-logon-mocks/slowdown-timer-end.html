	<h1>You had too many unsuccessful Single Sign-On attempts. Please wait a bit.</h1>

  <p>For your security we have slowed down your sign-on attempts. You can wait for the timer to expire and try signing in again, or go <a href="https://logon-asm1.logon.ucla.edu/passreset.php">reset your password</a> now if you've forgotten it.</p>
	
	<h2>You can attempt to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ucla-logon-mocks/">sign in again</a>!</h2>
